# Sunrise Capture
I like the sunrise and want to look at it, but I also like sleeping so I miss it.

Engineering to the rescue.


Please run install.sh and then use the scripts in the script folder.
Currently works with python2.7 but the installation in the install.sh script needs some tweaking.
Namely: Install the correct version of pip, and add pip to the PATH variable

Enjoy.
